$$</p><h2 id=private-solution-to-externalities>Private Solution to Externalities</h2><p>Consider the scenario of a power plant that is currently emitting tons of toxins in waterways, which adversely affects local fishermen.</p><p>Say you discover the power plant can eliminate the toxins that it emits by purchasing and installing scrubbers (a technology that cleans water and air before they are released into the ecosystem). But scrubbers are expensive to purchase and maintain, approximately 5 million.</p><p>The fishermen conclude that if they can convince the power plant to install the scrubbers, they will receive benefits over the next decade of approximately 7 million.</p><h3 id=case-1-the-power-plant-has-the-right-to-pollute>Case 1: The power plant has the right to pollute</h3><p>Because the power plant holds the right to pollute by law, it does not have to install expensive equipment.</p><p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the pollution will continue. As a matter of fact, if the power plant and the fishermen negotiate, it&rsquo;s possible that they will form a trade. The fishermen transfer more than 5 million and less than 7 million to the power plant in exchange of installtion of scrubbers.</p><h3 id=case-2-the-power-plant-does-not-have-the-right-to-pollute>Case 2: The power plant does not have the right to pollute</h3><p>Now let’s consider when the opposite case is at work: upon looking into the local ordinances, say that you, the mayor, had found a law against the power plant polluting the waterways. You would have then informed the power plant that it was out of compliance. If it chose at that point not to shut down, it would then have installed the scrubbers, thereby eliminating the water pollution.</p><h3 id=conclusion-the-coase-theorem>Conclusion: The Coase Theorem</h3><p>The remarkable bottom line is that regardless of whether the law permits the power plant to pollute or not, the economically efficient outcome is achieved either way.</p><p><strong>The Coase theorem</strong>: If private parties can bargain <strong>without cost</strong> over the allocation of resources, they can solve the externalities problem on their own.</p><h3 id=example-the-fable-of-the-bees>Example: The Fable of the Bees</h3><p>In the literature of economics, the standard example of a positive externality is the interaction between apple growing and beekeeping.</p><p>People who believe Pigou would have argued that this situation must result in suboptimal levels of output in both activities.</p><ul><li>An apple grower stops planting new trees as soon as the marginal cost of planting exceeds his private marginal benefit, failing to consider that further trees would benefit his neighbor.</li><li>The beekeeper performs a similar unfortunate calculation.</li></ul><p>Cheung investigated the accuracy of this fable by interviewing apple growers and beekeepers</p><p>He found that, contrary to the expectations of Pigou-style economists and exactly as Coase would have predicted, there is an elaborate system of contracts under which the two groups reimburse each other with ”bribes” for increasing output to the socially optimal levels.</p><h3 id=example-keeping-a-dog>Example: Keeping a Dog</h3><h4 id=case-1>CASE 1</h4><ul><li>Dick has the legal right to keep Spot</li><li>Benefit to Dick of having Spot = 500</li><li>Cost to Jane of Spot’s barking = 800</li></ul><p>Socially efficient outcome: Spot goes bye-bye.</p><p>Private outcome: Jane pays Dick 600 to get rid of Spot, both Jane and Dick are better off.</p><p>Private outcome = Efficient outcome.</p><h4 id=case-2>CASE 2</h4><ul><li>Dick has the legal right to keep Spot</li><li>Benefit to Dick of having Spot = 1000</li><li>Cost to Jane of Spot’s barking = 800</li></ul><p>Socially efficient outcome: See Spot stay.</p><p>Private outcome: Jane not willing to pay more than 800, Dick not willing to accept less than 1000, so Spot stays.</p><p>Private outcome = Efficient outcome.</p><h4 id=case-3>CASE 3</h4><ul><li>Benefit to Dick of having Spot = 1000</li><li>Cost to Jane of Spot’s barking = 800</li><li>But Jane has the legal right to peace and quiet.</li></ul><p>Socially efficient outcome: Dick keeps Spot.</p><p>Private outcome: Dick pays Jane 900 to put up with Spot’s barking.</p><p>Private outcome = Efficient outcome.</p><h3 id=why-private-solutions-do-not-always-work>Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work</h3><ol><li>Transaction costs: the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain</li><li>Sometimes, even when a beneficial agreement is possible, each party may hold out for a better deal.</li><li>Coordination problems & costs when the number of parties is large.</li></ol><h2 id=public-policies-to-externalities>Public Policies to Externalities</h2><p>Since private solutions might not work, we need introduction of public policies to solve externalities.</p><p>Acme and US Electric are two electricity company which run coal burning power plants. Each emits 40 tons of sulfur dioxide per month. SO2 causes acid rain & other health issues.</p><p>Policy goal: reducing SO2 emissions 25%</p><p>Suppose cost of reducing emissions is lower for Acme than for US Electric. So the socially efficient outcome is Acme reduces emissions more than US Electric.</p><h3 id=command-and-control-policies>Command-and-control policies</h3><p>Direct regulation is very simple, simply regulating the amount of emission by requiring each plant to cut emissions by 25%.</p><p>You can see that the outcome is not socially efficient because they all reduce the same amount of emissions.</p><h3 id=market-based-policy-1-corrective-taxes--subsidies>Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes & Subsidies</h3><p><strong>Corrective tax</strong> is a tax designed to induce private decision-makers to take account of the social costs that arise from a negative externality.</p><p>From the perspective of producers, if they pollute one unit of SO2, they need to pay the tax. So, the corrective tax is simply a ”price” on the right to pollute. Like other prices, the tax allocates this ”good” to the firms who value it most highly (US Electric), which is more efficient than direct command control.</p><h3 id=market-based-policy-2-tradable-pollution-permits>Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits</h3><p><strong>Tradable pollution permits</strong> is the permitted amount of pollution assigned to all the firms but allows trade between firms.</p><p>Due to the presence of trade,</p><ul><li>Firms with low cost of reducing pollution sell whatever permits they can.</li><li>Firms with high cost of reducing pollution buy permits.</li></ul><p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s also a more efficient method compared with direct command policy.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/lecture_notes/ECON102/ECON102-MOC>ECON102 MOC</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jnxc1234567890.github.io/js/graph.27e8521c25c27c79dea35f434c486167.js></script>
