Therefore, we use some fixed numbers of bits to represent a certain group of numbers, which introduced leading 0s.\ne.g.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n17_{10}=00010001_2 \\\\\n42_{10}=00101010_2 \n\\end{align}\n$$\n### Conversion from Binary to Decimal\nThe conversion from binary to decimal is quite straight forward, because the $i$th bit in binary represents $2^{i-1}$ .\ne.g. Convert $01001_2$\n$$\n01001_2 = (0 \\cdot 2^4 + 1 \\cdot 2^3+0 \\cdot 2^2+0 \\cdot 2^1+1 \\cdot 2^0)_{10}=9_{10}\n$$\n\n### Conversion from Decimal to Binary\nIt might not seem so straightforward as the previous one, but the core idea is the same.\ne.g. Convert $9_{10}$ to a 5-bit binary.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\u0026\\text{Assume } 9_{10} = a_4\\cdot 2^4 + a_3\\cdot 2^3 + a_2\\cdot 2^2+a_1\\cdot 2^1+a_0\\cdot2^0. \\\\\n\u0026\\text{Clearly, the parity of the number determined }a_0. \\\\\n\u0026(9-a_0) \\div 2 = a_4\\cdot 2^3 + a_3\\cdot 2^2 + a_2\\cdot 2^1+a_1\\cdot 2^0 \\\\\n\u0026\\text{Clearly, the parity of the number determined } a_1. \\\\\n\u0026((9-a_0)-a_1) \\div 2=a_4\\cdot 2^2 + a_3\\cdot 2^1 + a_2\\cdot 2^0 \\\\\n\u0026\\text{ Clearly, the parity of the number determined } a_2. \\\\\n\u0026\\cdots\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n## Addition of Unsigned Representation\nBinary addition is almost the same as decimal addition.\ne.g. $01001_2+01110_2$\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n_1\\quad \\quad  \u0026\\\\\n01001\u0026\\\\\n+01110\u0026\\\\\n\\hline\n10111\u0026\n\\end{align}\n$$\nHowever, sometimes things go wrong.\ne.g. $01001_2+11110_2$\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n_{1\\ 1} \\quad \\quad  \u0026\\\\\n01001\u0026\\\\\n+11110\u0026\\\\\n\\hline\n①10111\u0026\n\\end{align}\n$$\nNote there is a carry out 1. Because of bit limitation, it did not appear in the final result, causing a mismatch. This kind of phenomena is called overflow.\n\nTo sum up, the addition result of $N$ bit binary is\n$$\nS = (A+B)\\mod 2^N\n$$\n\n## 2's Complement\nHere comes the question, how to store negative numbers?\n\nThe easiest way is [[Sign-Magnitude]]. But our topic today focuses on 2's complement representation, which is the most widely used representation in computers nowadays.\n\nThe key concept of 2's complement representation is to make use of the same addition component as unsigned representation, which is to say,\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\u0026\\text{For a negative number }-k, \\text{ we wish to find its reprentation }P_k.\\\\\n\u0026\\text{So that }\\forall N \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\text{we have }(-k+N)\\equiv(P_{k}+N) \\mod 2^{N}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-20":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 20","content":"## Machine Models","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-21":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 21","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-22":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 22","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-23":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 23","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-3":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 3","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-4":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 4","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-5":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 5","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-6":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 6","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-Lecture-7":{"title":"ECE120 Lecture 7","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-14T10:31:03.007352514Z","tags":null},"/lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120-MOC":{"title":"ECE120 MOC","content":"## Course Description\nECE120: Intro to Computing Systems is a UIUC course about the structure of computing systems.\n\n## Lecture Notes\n1.
