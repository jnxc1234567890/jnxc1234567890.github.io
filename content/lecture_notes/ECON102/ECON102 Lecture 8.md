## Market Failures: Externalities
There are important cases in which free markets fail to maximize social surplus. We call such cases market failures. One of them is externality.

**Externality** is the uncompensated impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. _e.g._ smoking in public places without considering impact on others.

Market is **NOT** efficient when there are externalities. Because self-interested buyers and sellers neglect the external effects of their actions.

### Negative Externalities
**Negative externality** is when the effect on bystanders is adverse.

#### Air Pollution
The firm does not bear the full cost of its production, and so will produce more than the socially efficient quantity.

#### Other Examples
1. Your neighbor’s barking dog 
2. Late-night loud video games noises from the dorm room next to yours 
3. Noise pollution from construction projects near your house 
4. Talking on cell phone while driving makes the roads less safe for others 
5. Health risk to others from second-hand smoke

### Positive Externalities
**Positive Externality** is when the effect on bystanders is beneficial.

#### Benefit of Education
A more educated population benefits society: 
- lower crime rates: educated people have more opportunities, so less likely to rob and steal 
- better government: educated people make better-informed voters

However, people do not consider these external benefits when deciding how much education to “purchase”, so the market equilibrium education is low.

#### Other Examples
1. Being vaccinated against contagious diseases protects not only you, but people who visit the restaurants or cinemas 
2. R&D creates knowledge others can use

### Example: Gasoline Market
In the market of gasoline, there is additional cost to the society, or externalities in the gasoline transaction. These factors are not considered in previous analysis, so how to add them to our analysis?

#### Analysis of Negative Externalities
If taken the factors of externalities into account, the cost of society should also be considered, shifting the cost curve (supply curve) upward.

Therefore, we'll find that
$$
Q_{\text{private}}>Q_{\text{social}}
$$

#### Internalizing the Externality
One fundamental theme unites the multiple solutions to externalities, is try to let economic agents **internalizing** the externality, meaning individuals or companies take into account the full costs and benefits of their actions because of some public or private incentive.

When the external effects of their actions are internalized, the general result is that the market equilibrium moves toward higher social well-being.

#### Pigou Taxes
Suppose we impose a 1 per gallon tax on gasoline. The 1/gallon tax on sellers makes sellers’ costs equal to social costs. When market participants must pay social costs, the market equilibrium matches the social optimum.

Such taxes are called **Pigou taxes**.

#### Analysis of Positive Externality
Similarly, we can find the effect of positive externality on the market.

We'll find that
$$
Q_{\text{private}}<Q_{\text{social}}
