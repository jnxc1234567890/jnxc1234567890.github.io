## Market Failures: Externalities
There are important cases in which free markets fail to maximize social surplus. We call such cases market failures. One of them is externality.

**Externality** is the uncompensated impact of one personâ€™s actions on the well-being of a bystander. _e.g._ smoking in public places without considering impact on others.

**Negative externality** is when the effect on bystanders is adverse.



### Positive Externalities
**Positive Externality** is when the effect on bystanders is beneficial.
