## Production Possibilities Curve
**Production possibilities curve (PPC)** shows the relationship between the maximum production of one good for a given level of production of another good.

Below is an example of PPC between computer programs and websites for a person.

### Opportunity Cost on PPC
$$
\text{Opportunity Cost}_{\text{Websites}}=\frac{\text{Loss in computer programs}}{\text{Gain in Websites}}
$$
## Reasons behind Trade
### Comparative Advantage
Look at the PPC of two persons below:
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414180740.png]]

If we calculate the opportunity costs of two persons

| Individual | Website opportunity cost | Computer program opportunity cost |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| You        | 2 computer programs      | 1/2 websites                      |
| Olivia     | 1/2 computer programs    | 2 websites                        |

Clearly, you're more experienced in making computer programs while Olivia is more experienced in making websites. Then how to formally define this advantage?

**Comparative advantage** is the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a certain good at a _lower opportunity_ cost than other producers.

### Specialization
You might have come up with an idea that, if you and Olivia exchange some of your work, it will be beneficial for both of you. This strategy is called **specialization**.

Yes, and we can easily observe this fact by drawing the PPC of you and Olivia together.

The new PPC shows that, the total amount of production is maximized at point $T$, which is exactly the point where complete specialization happens.

### Absolute Advantage
