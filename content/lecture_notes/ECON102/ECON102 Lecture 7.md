## Production Possibilities Curve
**Production possibilities curve (PPC)** shows the relationship between the maximum production of one good for a given level of production of another good.

Below is an example of PPC between computer programs and websites for a person.
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414180225.png]]

### Opportunity Cost on PPC
$$
\text{Opportunity Cost}_{\text{Websites}}=\frac{\text{Loss in computer programs}}{\text{Gain in Websites}}
$$
## Reasons behind Trade
### Comparative Advantage
Look at the PPC of two persons below:
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414180740.png]]

If we calculate the opportunity costs of two persons

| Individual | Website opportunity cost | Computer program opportunity cost |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| You        | 2 computer programs      | 1/2 websites                      |
| Olivia     | 1/2 computer programs    | 2 websites                        |

Clearly, you're more experienced in making computer programs while Olivia is more experienced in making websites. Then how to formally define this advantage?

**Comparative advantage** is the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a certain good at a _lower opportunity_ cost than other producers.

### Specialization
You might have come up with an idea that, if you and Olivia exchange some of your work, it will be beneficial for both of you. This strategy is called **specialization**.

Yes, and we can easily observe this fact by drawing the PPC of you and Olivia together.
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414181517.png]]

The new PPC shows that, the total amount of production is maximized at point $T$, which is exactly the point where complete specialization happens.

### Absolute Advantage
However, things won't be so ideal all the time. Look at the example below:
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414195209.png]]

**Absolute advantage** is the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce more of a certain good than other competing producers, given
the same amount of resources.

If we measure the absolute advantage here, we'll find that you're more productive than Olivia in all the products. The new opportunity cost is:


| Individual | Website opportunity cost | Computer program opportunity cost |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| You        | 2/3 computer programs    | 3/2 websites                      |
| Olivia     | 1/2 computer programs    | 2 websites                        | 

You can still trade though, because you have comparative advantage in computer programs. But  you'll find that you did not gain in the trade: for each computer program you sold, you only get 1 website, which is even less than what you get when you produce the website yourself.

### Price of Trade
But this doesn't mean that trade can't happen. We have overlooked something important here, **terms of trade**, which is the negotiated exchange rate of goods for goods.

Still the example above, if we say that 1 computer program can exchange more than 1.5 websites, it will be acceptable for you; if 1 website can exchange more than 0.5 computer programs, it will be acceptable for Olivia. This implies that when $\text{computer program}:\text{website}\in (3/2,2)$, the trade will be beneficial for both of you. If the ratio is closer to 2, it will be more beneficial to you, vice versa.

Another interesting observation is that the gains to trade shrink as the trading partners become more alike.

## Trade between countries
Manufactured goods have played an important role in the balance of imports and exports, causing the increadible free trade worldwide.

But there're still some voices against WTO and free trade, what's the cause?

Let's firstly consider a market without export/import.
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414203539.png]]

### Exporting Nations
When $P_{\text{world}}>P_{\text{domestic}}$, the country is an exporting nation.
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414203558.png]]

Clearly, suppliers in exporting nations won't remain it's domestic price, the price will rapidly rise to world price, causing the shrink of domestic demand.

Clearly, the sellers has an increased producer surplus of $B+C$, making them better off. However, consumers surplus shrink by $B$, making them worse off.

1. Sellers win.
2. Buyers lose.

But if we look at the social surplus, it definitely grows. The government could use tax to transfer revenues from sellers to buyers to make the entire society better.

### Importing Nations
Let's have a look at importing nations.
![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414204758.png]]

Clearly, using the same analysis, we'll draw the conclusion:
1. Sellers lose 
2. Buyers win

Still, the social surplus increases, tax might be a solution to compensate sellers.

### Other Benefits of World Trade
1. Consumers: increased variety of goods 
2. Producers: lower costs - economies of scale 
3. Increased competition: reduce market power of domestic firms (increase total welfare)
4. Enhanced flow of ideas, facilitates the spread of technological advances around the world

### Determinants of a Country’s Comparative Advantage
1. Natural resources (to a large degree, beyond the countries’ control, unless squandered) 
2. 2. Stocks of human-made resources (more controllable; depend on the PPC)
3. Technology 
4. Education, work habits, and experience of the labor force 
5. Relative abundance of labor and physical capital 
6. Climate

## Arguments Against Free Trade
Why did both President Trump and Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton create platforms that challenged free trade during the 2016 Presidential campaign? Several arguments are typically set forth:

### 1. National security concerns
Allowing resources to flow freely has the effect of allocating resources in and across industries efficiently. But that may mean the creation of **“banana republics”**— nations that specialize in the production of one good.

Though this might be efficient economically, it may not be optimal in a defense-oriented world, where national security is an important consideration.

### 2. Fear of Globalization on a Nation’s Culture
As the world becomes increasingly interdependent, it also becomes increasingly homogeneous, some people fear the loss of their cultural identity through such globalization. 
- Decades ago China had no McDonald’s; now in large cities there is one on every corner 
- Starbucks now serves coffee in more than sixty countries

Such preferences are an important consideration for leaders around the world.

### 3. Environmental and Resource Concerns
Countries with lax environmental policies allow for relatively more pollution from firms than do countries with strong environmental policies. 

Opponents of free trade often cite these policy differences as creating “pollution havens” in poor countries.

These countries, in an effort to promote economic growth and jobs, use lax pollution regulations to attract industry.

### 4. Infant Industry Arguments
Opponents of free trade also cite the ”infant industries” argument, in which governments protect their fledgling domestic industries against more advanced competitors.

### Tariffs
**Tariff** is the tax on goods produced abroad and sold domestically. It's one type of protectionism.

![[lecture_notes/ECON102/images/Pasted image 20220414210737.png]]

If a 15 tariff is imposed on shoes, the local market price rises from 25 to 40.

1. The imposition of the tariff reduces consumer surplus to the area B, F, and H.
2. The producer surplus is areas A + E.
3. The government receives the number of import goods times the tariff price in revenue. This revenue equals 15 * 1 million = 15 million, or the area of rectangle I.
4. What about areas G and J? This is the deadweight loss of the tariff.

Tariff reduces social surplus but protects local industries, most economists in general do not favor such protectionism—it raises prices for consumers and lowers social surplus.
