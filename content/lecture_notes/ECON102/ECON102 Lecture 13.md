## Market Concentration and Oligopoly
### Market Concentration
**Concentration ratio** is the  percentage of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms. The higher the concentration ratio, the less competition.

### Oligopoly
Oligopoly is market structure in which only a few sellers offer similar or identical products. i.e. high concentration ratios.

Strategic behavior in oligopoly:
- A firmâ€™s decisions about P or Q can affect other firms and cause them to react 
- The firm will consider these reactions when making decisions

The study of how people behave in strategic situations leads to **game theory**.
