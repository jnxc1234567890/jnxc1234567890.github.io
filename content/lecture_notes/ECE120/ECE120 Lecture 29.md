## From FSM to LC-3
We have already implemented a binary counter using FSM in [[lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120 Lecture 19|Lecture 19]].

But now we're going to try something different! Implement an LC-3 program doing the same job: counting to 10.

## Three Types of Adressing Design
We have three diffent types of adressing mode:
- 

## LC-3 Binary Code
