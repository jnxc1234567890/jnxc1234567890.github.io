## Overflow
### Overflow in Unsigned Representation
It is quite easy to find the overflow condition of unsigned representation.

### Overflow in [[lecture_notes/ECE120/ECE120 Lecture 2#2's Complement|2's Complement]] Representation


## Boolean Algebra
**Boolean algebra** is invented to reason about logical propositions.

### Boolean Function
A Boolean function is defined by 
$$
f:\{ 0,1 \}^k\to\{ 0,1 \}
$$

### Truth Table
Due to the finiteness of domain, a Boolean function can be fully defined by a **truth table**. For example, the following table is a truth table for a 2-input function:

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |     |
| 0   | 1   |     |
| 1   | 0   |     |
| 1   | 1   |     |

### Typical Boolean Functions
#### AND

#### OR

#### NOT

#### XOR
