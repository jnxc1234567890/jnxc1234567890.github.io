## Representation Matters
The way how data represented is crucial to machine learning.

Above is an example of how transforming from Cartesian coordinate to Polar corrdinate helps improving performance of Logistic Regression networks.

Of course, increasing model complexity also might achieve a good classification.

When the Logistic Regression is replaced with a MLP, the performance greatly increases.
